# Experiment 6: Implementation of Multivariate Displays
Introduction
Multivariate data visualization plays a crucial role in AI analytics by enabling the analysis of relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. Unlike simple two-dimensional plots, multivariate displays help uncover complex patterns, correlations, and trends that are not easily observable otherwise.

This experiment focuses on implementing key multivariate visualization techniques using R to analyze retail business data.

 Objective
- To understand the importance of multivariate displays in data analysis  
- To visualize relationships among Sales, Profit, Discount, Region, and Customer Segment  
- To interpret insights from different visualization techniques
- 
 Tools Used
- R Programming
- RStudio
- ggplot2
- GGally
- dplyr
- 
 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains retail transaction information with the following variables:
- **Order_ID** – Unique order identifier  
- **Region** – Geographic region of sales  
- **Product_Category** – Category of the product  
- **Sales** – Sales amount  
- **Profit** – Profit earned  
- **Discount** – Discount applied  
- **Customer_Segment** – Type of customer  
 Visualization Techniques Implemented

 Parallel Coordinates Plot
This plot was used to visualize multiple numerical variables together. Each data record is represented as a line crossing parallel axes. It helps in identifying inverse relationships, trends, and outliers across customer segments.

 Bubble Chart (Sales vs Profit)
A bubble chart was used to represent Sales and Profit, with bubble size indicating Discount and color representing Region. This visualization helps in understanding how discount levels impact profitability across regions.

Trellis Display (Faceted Scatter Plots)
Trellis displays were created by faceting Sales vs Profit plots based on Region. This method simplifies complex data by breaking it into smaller, comparable subsets, making regional performance patterns easier to observe.

 Observations and Insights
- Higher discount levels generally showed a negative impact on profit  
- Sales and Profit relationships varied significantly across regions  
- Customer segments behaved differently under similar sales conditions  
- Faceting helped isolate and compare regional trends effectively  
Limitations
- Overlapping points in dense regions reduce clarity  
- Bubble size comparison is visually less precise  
- Interpreting multiple variables simultaneously requires higher cognitive effort  
Conclusion
Multivariate displays provide powerful insights into complex datasets by allowing simultaneous analysis of multiple variables. The techniques implemented in this experiment are highly useful in exploratory data analysis, AI model evaluation, and decision-making processes.
